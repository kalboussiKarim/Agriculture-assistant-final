# Agriculture assistant application
This app is designed to help farmers monitor and manage their crops. It includes features like weather tracking, alerts for fire detection or intrusions, and real-time monitoring through IoT sensors. The app also allows users to control actuators such as water pumps, light bulbs, and other equipment remotely via a simple mobile interface. Additionally, the app enables users to control a robot equipped with a camera, allowing them to inspect and monitor their farm from a distance. Users can also receive important notifications and access data to optimize their farming operations.
